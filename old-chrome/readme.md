# Classic Google Chrome theme for Firefox
This is a theme for Firefox (pre-FF77) that seeks to emulate classic Google Chrome.

If this doesn't work on the latest Firefox version, please re-read the description.

## How to install
Throw everything in here into your AppData/Roaming/Mozilla/Firefox/Profiles/(your profile)/chrome folder.

If you don't download everything in this folder, the theme might break.
## Notes
Tested on Waterfox only.

You may fork this to make a version for post-FF77 versions of Firefox.
